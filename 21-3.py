# Finger exercise: You are wandering through a forest and see a field of delicious-looking mushrooms.
# You fill your basket with them, and head home prepared to cook them up and serve them to your
# husband. Before you cook them, however, he demands that you consult a book about local mushroom
# species to check whether they are poisonous. The book says that 80% of the mushrooms in the local
# forest are poisonous. However, you compare your mushrooms to the ones pictured in the book, and
# decide that you are 95% certain that your mushrooms are safe. How comfortable should you be about
# serving them to your husband (assuming that you would rather not become a widow)?
